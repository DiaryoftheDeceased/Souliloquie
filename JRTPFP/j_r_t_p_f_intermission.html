        <p>I woke up in my bed.</p>
        <p>How? I do not know.</p>
        <p>I sigh in my hands, “If would have known it would have turned out like this I never would have said anything.”</p>
        <p>I have seen and experienced some things, but this is at the top of the list.</p>
        <p>I look around my room.</p>
        <p>I look at my arm.</p>
        <p>Strange.</p>
        <p>I could not have done it then. . .</p>
        <p>Right on cue Mara comes around the corner and leans on the doorway.</p>
        <p>I got tired of you looking so pathetic. You're welcome.”</p>
        <p>I just stare at her.</p>
        <p>That ‘you’re welcome’ had malice behind it.</p>
        <p>Yes, I am grateful she didn’t let me bleed out; Just… Why did it have to be her?</p>
        <p>‘And you're still not going to speak to me.” She said looking at me undereye.</p>
        <p>She shakes her head, as if she had already come to a conclusion.</p> 
        <p>“How long are you going to keep up this act? Quite frankly, it is juvenile. You-”</p>
        <p>“I have all this power and for what?.” I say in a whisper.</p>
        <p>Tears threatened to escape my eyes. I dare not look at her. I really don't feel like being pitied or comforted right now.</p>
        <p>She begins to open her mouth.</p>
        <p>I shake my head no.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I had a dream. A boy. We were around each other as friends. He was fun. The dream felt great. Like a breath of fresh air.</p>
        <p>This was months prior to the garden showing up.</p>
        <p>Months later, in the garden, a soul in purple light appears.</p>
        <p>It was unexpected.</p>
        <p>They felt familiar.</p>
        <p>Like we have met before.</p>
        <p>For about some months, We would talk with them in the garden.<p>
        <p>Life was alright.</p>
        <p>Another soul I could trust.</p>
        <p>Then later on in the season, I go to the garden and something feels off. I ignore it. I wanted the flowers from the garden. So.....</p>
        <p>I could put them in my castle to serve as a reminder of the friendship. I dig up the roots of the flowers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>The roots are black.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>   
        <p>I did this for about a while with all the flowers to confirm my suspicions.</p>
        <p>All the flowers were in the process of dying.</p>
        <p>Then later, I would meet up with my friendly stranger.</p>
        <p>Every time I did,  it would feel. . .</p>  
        <p>Like Ania was there.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I could not make myself go to the garden</p> 
        <p>Because something more sinister was there.</p> 
        <p>I stayed away.</p>
        <p>I didn't know what was happening until it was too late.</p>
        <p>No, I did know the future.</p>   
        <p>I decided not to acknowledge the garden's fate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I decided to delay the lesson.</p> 
        <p>I decided to not listen to the spirits.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Back in the ending months of the year,</p>
        <p>I wanted to rid the garden.</p> 
        <p>Ania almost killed me.</p>
        <p>I was in bad shape.</p>   
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I found myself back in the garden.</p>
        <p>They-he gave me a letter.</p>  
        <p>There were some lifelong words.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>I thought we were almost the same until, </p>
        <p>I found out that he can't see ghosts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>   
        <p>I know most about him and his world.</p>
        <p>He is unknown to no life and the after.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>Sadly, it is pointless to continue the garden.</p>
        <p>"Why have a garden, when you knew you could not have kept it alive?"</p>
        <p>My head turns greatly at her.</p>
        <p>I start laugh hysterically.</p>
        <p>"You don't get it. MARA. YOU. DO. NOT GET. IT."</p>
        <p>"Do you know how it feels to be dead, and die all the time?</p>
        <p>as much as I like being dead, there are side effects.</p>
        <p>Where I am trying to go and do.</p>
        <p>I have to keep dying, and dying, and dying, AND DYING AND DYING!</p>
        <p>SADLY, THIS IS ANOTHER DEATH.</p>
        <p>It feels like I have been stabbed with a double-rigged sword.</p>
        <p>SO PUT ME ON TRIAL IF I LOOK PATHETIC TO YOU."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I did not realize that I was standing.</p>
        <p>"What gives you right to yell at me, when I myself have suffered a death, by yours truly?"</p>
        <p>I look up,</p>
        <p>There is a dark aura around her.</p>
        <p>It changes colors</p>
        <p>Bloodred red.</p>
        <p>Black as the abyss</p>
        <p>Purple as the deepest cosmos.</p>
        <p>In a blink of an eye she is a 10ft creature comprised of grief, anger, and sadness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In this moment I can feel her.</p>
        <p>It feels like betrayal.</p>
        <p>Like how a child put all their faith in their caregiver.</p>
        <p>All for the caregiver to abandon them.</p>
        <p>This time I do not back down.</p>
        <p>I do not run.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I'm already dying, what is a little more pain?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With her new persona,</p>
        <p>She holds me by the neck in the air</p> 
        <p>And chokes the life I have left.</p>
        <p>As honest as I am, I feel like I deserve this.</p>
        <p>I am losing greatly.</p>
        <p>I have abandoned her.</p>
        <p>I have guilt about getting rid of the garden.</p>
        <p>I am tired and I need to rest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a long three minutes with me, her and the sound of me gasping for air,</p>
        <p>I managed to say;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am sorry.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her eyes widened.</p>
        <p>Her grip gets tighter.</p>
        <p>I care not, as long as it makes her feel better.</p>
        <p>She releases me. I drop hard onto the floor.</p>
        <p>Air is divine to be indulged.</p>
        <p>As I get up she is still the creature.</p>
        <p>I am the reason she is.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Mara, I am sorry for abandoning you.</p>
        <p>It is my fault that poison is in your heart.</p>
        <p>Thick as tar.</p>
        <p>I am the reason you are.</p>
        <p>You were my responsibility, and I have failed you.</p>
        <p>I am truly sorry for the pain that you have caused you.</p>
        <p>Do not forgive me, I do not deserve it. For I have failed you. I am a terrible person because of my own incompetence and cowardice."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She backs away.</p>
        <p>I begin to hear horrific screaming.</p>
        <p>Her body pulsates and melts.</p>
        <p>Black gooey flesh falls to the ground.</p>
        <p>It reeks profusely.</p>
        <p>The dirt reacts fearfully to the acid-like goo.</p>
        <p>She slams herself against the walls.</p>
        <p>Trying to escape the creature she has become.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a distorted voice I hear her say:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"It hurts, it hurts, my divine IT HURTS!</p>
        <p>HELP ME! GET IT OFF ME!"</p>
        <p>The screeching of a human.</p>
        <p>In pain.</p>
        <p>Clawing at her face.</p>
        <p>Tearing her body apart bit by bit.</p>
        <p>I can only look.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My legs fail me.</p>
        <p>This time I cannot help her.</p>
        <p>She needs to conquer the hatred that has consumed her.</p>
        <p>Falling to the ground with the rest of her body melting away.</p>
        <p>Clawing at her face.</p>
        <p>She begins to cry out and weep for the last time</p>
        <p>Before she flees the castle.</p>
