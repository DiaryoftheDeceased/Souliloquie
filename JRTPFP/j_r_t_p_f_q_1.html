        <h2>Quest 1</h2>
        <h3>5•5•2024•5:03am</h3>

        <p>I did not mean to start the journie this day,</p>
        <p>Though the body lost that battle.</p>
        <p>I traveled by spirit.</p>
        <p>I am not awake.</p>
        <p>My spirit soared through the cosmos.</p>
        <p>I passed by so many flowers.</p>
        <p>The forever sunset, I joied.</p>
        <p>It’s calm here; To my shock.</p>
        <p>Blue, purple, pink, orange.</p>
        <p>A beautiful canvas.</p>
        <p>I would like to meet its artist one day.</p>
        <p>My first ever journie; quest.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>   
        <p>It may not be my forte; I give credit where due.</p>
        <p>I think the cosmos is wanting to speak.</p>
        <p>I dim my sight.</p>
        <p>I open them to a very open place.</p>
        <p>A blue sky.</p>
        <p>Atop of a building?</p>
        <p>I am in the modern realm.</p>
        <p>Reality.</p>
        <p>I no longer crave to inhabit a place such as.</p>
        <p>Why are you presenting me this?</p> 
        <p>I turn to see a person shroud in a very light hue.</p> 
        <p>Lilac.</p>   
        <p>My friendly stranger.</p>
        <p>I only have met them in the farthest part of my garden.</p>
        <p>How-Why am I here?</p>  
        <p>This is not my domain.</p>
        <p>I will like to leave.</p> 
        <p>As much as I want to; I can not.</p> 
        <p>The same I know.</p>   
        <p>The cosmos will not let me leave.</p>
        <p>Until I see what is needed to see.</p>
        <p>It tells me to let go of what I know; See.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I trust the cosmos to not steer me wrongly.</p>
        <p>So I do.</p>
        <p>I surrender.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am-It is unbelievable.</p> 
        <p>I can see what they look like.</p>   
        <p>They-He is immensely pleasing to one's ocular.</p>
        <p>Long hair.</p>
        <p>Sleepy eyes.</p>  
        <p>And a very puzzling demeanor.</p>
        <p>He is not distressed.</p> 
        <p>More of in thought.</p> 
        <p>He looks out in the distance.</p>   
        <p>What can his gaze be on?</p>
        <p>I have not ever been this close before.</p>
        <p>I am always far away…</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was just a mere minute.</p>
        <p>In what felt like hours.</p>
        <p>I seen where he dwells.</p>
        <p>Yet I did not ask to journie here.</p> 
        <p>So why; Is my question.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am genuinely concerned that there may be a lesson on the horizon.</p>
