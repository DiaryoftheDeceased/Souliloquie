    <div class="container">
        <p>To roam the evening looking for a suited tongue.<br>
        The men waltz with rose, and the woman, champagne.<br>
        Masks abundant and none to reveal truth.<br>

        <p>I have not a mask. I care not for deceit.<br>
        I frolic about. Til my hearts and feet desire.<br>

        <p>One has my eyes.<br>
        One with such charm. One with such a mask, that is beautiful.<br>
        
        I approach and decide that I want to take them under my wings.<br>
        
        I ask for a dance.<br>
        
        They entice me with their mask instead.<br>
        They speak of their jewels and stitch making.</p>

        <p>I am entranced, like a sailor and a siren.<br>
        
        I ask for yet again for their hand to dance.<br>
        They gesture toward the dance floor.<br>
        
        Ecstatic runs through my veins like its kin, blood.<br>
        I feel them caress both arms as we walk the dance floor.<br>

        A faint feeling of uncertainty.<br>
        I want to dance.<br>
        
        <p>My chosen waltzer holds me close.<br>
        The uncertainty.<br>
        I want to dance.<br>
        They thought it was best to embed a knife inside me.<br>

        <p>Why is their iridescent liquid on the floor?<br>
        Was there an accident?<br>
        Why do I feel pain?<br>
        
        I have been stabbed.<br>
        
        I just wanted to dance.</p>

        <p>They are still behind me, holding me close.<br>
        They speak but I cannot hear them.<br>
        I can no longer be here. I will die.<br>
        I push them away; I bolt far from the soiree.<br>

           Pain.</p>
        <p>Disgust.<br>
           Shame.</p>

        <p>I collapse somewhere. I don't know how long I have run for.<br>
        I feel dirty.<br>
        I want to ripe off the largest organ off of me.<br>
        
        <p>I bleed a glorious assortment of hues.<br>
            Beautifully and divinely dying.<br>
            I choke up hues.<br>
            Air devoid me.<br>

        <p>After what felt like an eternity, I can feel myself change.<br>
        The colors turning from luminous to dark as the 4th hour of night.<br>
        
        <p>I weep and claw at myself.<br>
            This is not what I wanted.<br>
            I just wanted to dance.<br>
            I feel corrupted.<br>

        <p>In the moonlight, I can see that I have killed much.<br>
            My pretty blood decorates the grass that was once full of life.<br> 
            
        <p>I go to look at the pond near me.<br>

        <p>I see a monster.<br>
        I see a person made of sin.<br>
        Dark horns, wings bigger than before.<br>
        Eyes like the abyss.<br>
        <p>Hands like Obsidian.<br>

        <p>I let out a cry and weep more.<br>

        <p>I just wanted to dance.<br>
        Flawed by naivety, my demise.<br>
        I should have worn a mask.<br>
        I am at fault.<br>
        <p>All because I wanted to dance.<br>
