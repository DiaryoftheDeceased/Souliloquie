        <h1>Journie: Retrieve the Purple Flower: Quest 3</h1>
        <h3>[Time & date forgotten because of my faults]</h3>
        
        <p>I have visited the cosmos again.<br>
        I hope to see more.<br>
        I hope to see the truth.<br>
        What is it that I am missing?</p>

        <p>I am placed in an area.<br>
        Again, the modern realm.<br>
        It looks to be a parking lot.</p>

        <p>He sits on the concrete.<br>
        Talking enthusiastically.<br>
        To me?<br>
        I do not know.<br>
        He looks happy.<br>
        Happiness looks great on him.</p>

        <p>It is strange.<br>
        He is talking directly at me.<br>
        Not to me.<br>
        Can he not see me?<br>
        I am here.<br>
        Am I a ghost?<br>
        Can I manifest in the modern world?<br>
        Or is it his ability to see the dead?</p>

        <p>I look around.<br>
        The surroundings are covered in mist.<br>
        Why am I viewing this?<br>
        I do not want to be here,<br>
        When the dead is not revered.</p>

        <p>I can hear & see.<br>
        I am in front of you.<br>
        Within arms length.<br>
        Yet you can not see...<br>
        Me.</p>

        <p>I want to leave.<br>
        Cosmos.<br>
        Why are you not listening to me?<br>
        Please.<br>
        Please let me leave.</p>

        <p>The Cosmos tell me not yet.<br>
        The journie is not yet finished.</p>

        <p>I tell the Cosmos aloud,<br>
        “What kind of test is this that I must endure? From past endeavors, I know I must suffer greatly. Why must you break me completely each time to do so?”<br>
        The Cosmos rebuttals:<br>
        “I am a teacher of many. The student must learn and conquer. The student can not learn if there is no turmoil. Everything I do is within reason. To learn is to become stronger. To reach higher plains, you first must dig up the roots and realize what needs to be mend.<br>
        Once you wake, you’ll understand what needs to be done.”</p>

        <p>The Cosmos says that what they do is within reason.<br>
        This is painful.<br>
        This is torturous.<br>
        I have no will here.<br>
        I want to go home.</p>

        <p>I have known for months that this was inevitable.<br>
        I just did not know it was going to hurt this much.</p>
