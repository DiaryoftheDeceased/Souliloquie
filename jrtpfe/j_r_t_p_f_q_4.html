        <h2>Quest 4</h2>
        <h3>06-06-2024 - 09-02-2024 11:23pm</h3>

        <p>I tried to run after her.</p>
        <p>She was already gone.</p>
        <p>I followed the dark goo.</p>
        <p>It lead to the garden.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The air is strange.</p>
        <p>I walk around the garden.</p>
        <p>I hear a noise.</p>
        <p>Deep growling.</p>
        <p>I see Mara, or what is left of her.</p>
        <p>She charges at me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I hear in my head</p>
        <p>“I am far too gone.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I am to fight you, even if I disagree with harming you further.”</p>
        <p>I say.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I speak a spell.</p>
        <p>It grants me a weapon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A spear, a golden and opalescent spear.</p>
        <p>I wield the spear against her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I stay light on my feet.</p>
        <p>Attacking and dodging.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She is fading.</p>
        <p>She looks at me, stops and screams to the heavens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>LIGHTNING!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It strikes ten feet behind me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>“My Mara, if you were aiming for me, you have greatly missed my grief.”</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>   
        <p>Next came a screech like no other.</p>
        <p>It shakes the earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I smell smoke.</p>  
        <p>Fire.</p>
        <p>I turn around.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The garden is on fire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am hit; my body is flung into the heliotropes.</p>   
        <p>I taste blood.</p>
        <p>The earth is spinning though it's just my head that is in orbit.</p>
        <p>Breathing is now a task.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am on the ground.</p>
        <p>Where is my spear?</p>
        <p>She is coming closer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Through my blurry vision I see a very light purple on the right of Mara.</p> 
        <p>My friendly stranger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It is not safe in the garden.”</p> 
        <p>I yell.</p>   
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He walks closer.</p>
        <p>“This is the final time I will be able to help you.”</p>  
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am confused.</p>
        <p>“What do you mean final time?”</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He starts to glow brighter. Almost a blinding shade of purple.</p>
        <p>He stands very still in front of me.</p>   
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I know what I am to do next.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>I get to my feet.</p>
        <p>I run at full speed to Mara.</p>
        <p>She does the same.</p>
        <p>She has been reduced to a creature fully.</p>
        <p>Running on all fours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It feels divine to be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I only have one chance to do this.</p>
        <p>I stop to say:</p>
        <p>“MARA, YOU WERE MY BIGGEST MISTAKE.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This ensures a screech full of rage.</p>
        <p>I betrack and run toward the garden ablaze.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mara is catching wind.</p>
        <p>She grabs me.</p>
        <p>It gives me enough time for me pull her forward and do the unthinkable.</p>
        <p>I put my hand through her chest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Right, on que,</p>
        <p>my friendly stranger,</p>
        <p>expands his light through the entire garden.</p>
        <p>He ignites the garden in dark purple flames.</p>
        <p>Purple and Red.</p>
        <p>The world turned Velvet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With my hand in Mara's heart, tears escape my eyes.</p>
        <p>I look at the garden, he is facing me.</p>
        <p>He stands still.</p>
        <p>The flames engulf him.</p>
        <p>Along with the garden he came from.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I look away.</p>
        <p>I close my eyes and rip Mara’s heart out.</p>
        <p>Screaming. The goo has melts from her body.</p>
        <p>I catch her body in my arms.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“My Mara, my Mara, my Mara.”</p>
        <p>I hold her in my arms.</p>
        <p>Her head on my chest.</p>
        <p>She is soft.</p>
        <p>Her hair is long.</p>
        <p>She is beautiful.</p>
        <p>It would have been a magnificent sight.</p>
        <p>If only.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She smiles warmly.</p>
        <p>“I am expiring?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I say nothing.</p>
        <p>Instead I rest my chin on top of her head.</p>
        <p>I rock her back and forth like a child.</p>
        <p>She coughs.</p>
        <p>“I knew I wasn't going to be there with you going forward. Now that that time is here. It’s Tragic.”</p>
        <p>She grabs my hand.</p>
        <p>“You are the reason I am.” She whispers.</p>
        <p>“And I am the reason you are, my grief.” I finish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She is grey.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My grief is gone.</p>
        <p>My grief has turned into white petals.</p>
        <p>The wind will carry her far.</p>
        <p>It will go and not create anew</p>
        <p>My grief, for I have made you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You were the reason I am.</p>
        <p>I am the reason you were.</p>
