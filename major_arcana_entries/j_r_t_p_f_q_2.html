        <h2>Quest 2</h2>
        <h3>5•7•2024•10:21pm</h3>

        <p>I have visit the cosmos again.</p>
        <p>I hope to see more.</p>
        <p>I hope to see the truth.</p>
        <p>What is it that I am missing?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am placed in an area.</p>
        <p>Again, the modern realm.</p>
        <p>It looks to be a lot for chariots.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sits on the concrete.</p>
        <p>Talking enthusiastically.</p>
        <p>To me?</p>
        <p>I do not know.</p>
        <p>He seems to be happy.</p> 
        <p>Happiness looks great on him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is strange.</p>
        <p>He is talking directly at me.</p>
        <p>Not to me.</p>
        <p>Can he not see me?</p>
        <p>I am here.</p>
        <p>Am I a ghost?</p>
        <p>Can I manifest in the modern world?</p>
        <p>Or is it his ability to see the dead?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I look around.</p>
        <p>The surroundings are covered in mist.</p> 
        <p>Why am I viewing this?</p> 
        <p>I do not want to be here,</p>   
        <p>When the dead is not revered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I can hear & see.</p>
        <p>I am in front of you.</p>  
        <p>Within arms length.</p>
        <p>Yet your gaze...</p> 
        <p>Is so far away.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I want to leave.</p>   
        <p>Cosmos.</p>
        <p>Why are you not listening to me?</p>
        <p>Please.</p> 
        <p>Please let me leave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Cosmos tell me not yet.</p>
        <p>The journie is not yet finished.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I tell the Cosmos aloud,</p> 
        <p>“What kind of test is this that I must endure? From past endeavors, I know I must suffer greatly. Why must you break me completely each time to do so?”</p>
        <p>The Cosmos rebuttals:</p> 
        <p>“I am a teacher of many. The student must learn and conquer. The student can not learn if there is no turmoil. Everything I do is within reason. To learn is to become stronger. To reach higher plains, you first must dig up the roots and realize what needs to be mend.</p>   
        <p>Once you wake, you’ll understand what needs to be done.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Cosmos says that what they do is within reason.</p>  
        <p>This is painful.</p>
        <p>This is torturous.</p> 
        <p>I have no will here.</p> 
        <p>I want to go home.</p>   
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have known for months that this was inevitable.</p>
        <p>I just did not know it was going to hurt this much.</p>
